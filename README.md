# GS/EECS6322 Reproducibility Challenge (Section M Winter 2024)
- Shogo Toyonaga
- Aaryaman Kartha
## Paper 
Our Reproducibility Challenge is based on the following paper, [Efficient Classificication of Very Large Images with Tiny Objects (Kong and Henao)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Kong_Efficient_Classification_of_Very_Large_Images_With_Tiny_Objects_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf). 
## Code 
Our reproduction of the paper's experiments can be found in [6322_Zoom_In_Network.ipynb](https://github.com/stoyonaga/EECS6322/blob/main/Code/6322_Zoom_In_Network.ipynb). The other notebooks are fragments where we developed proof-of-concepts. If you have any problems running the code, please feel free to reach out to us :)
